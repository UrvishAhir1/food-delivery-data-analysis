# Food Delivery Data Analysis

This project analyzes food delivery data provided in CSV, JSON, and SQL formats
as part of the Innomatics Research Labs hackathon.

The datasets were merged using Python and Pandas, and the final data was used
to answer analytical questions related to revenue, users, and restaurants.
